# 🚀 OpenMUC Modbus Serial Communication Driver

## 🔍 Overview

This project implements a **Modbus RTU serial communication driver** using the powerful [OpenMUC framework](https://openmuc.org). It enables reliable data exchange with Modbus devices over serial ports (COM/tty), making it ideal for industrial automation, monitoring, and control systems.

Designed as an OSGi bundle, it seamlessly integrates into the OpenMUC ecosystem, supporting both **read** and **write** operations on Modbus slave devices.
